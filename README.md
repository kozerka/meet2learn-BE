### Code Samples

#### User Authentication Middleware

```javascript
const auth = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
	let token;

	token = req.cookies.jwt;

	if (token) {
		try {
			const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);

			req.user = await User.findById(decoded.userId).select('-password');

			next();
		} catch (error) {
			res.status(401);
			throw new Error('Not authorized, token failed');
		}
	} else {
		res.status(401);
		throw new Error('Not authorized, no token');
	}
});
```

#### Image Upload with Multer and Cloudinary

```javascript
cloudinary.config({
	cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
	api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_APIKEY,
	api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

export const storage = new CloudinaryStorage({
	cloudinary,
	allowedFormats: ['jpg', 'png', 'jpeg'],
	params: {
		folder: 'meet2learn',
		transformation: [{ width: 500, height: 500, crop: 'fit' }],
	},
});

## üëâ Getting Started

To use all BE functionalities on the FE, remember to download the FE from the link and run it according to the instructions provided 
[go to FE repository](https://github.com/kozerka/meet2learn-FE)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [Repo-URL]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd [Repo-Name]
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
- Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can use the .env.example - change name to .env 
- Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., database URI, JWT secret).
    ```
    DB_USER=YOUR_USER_NAME
    DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
    DB_HOST=DATABASE_HOST_NAME

    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=4000(PORT ACCORDING YOUR PREFERENCES)
    JWT_SECRET=SECRET_TOKEN
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN=ADD_EXPIRE_TIME
    NODEMAILER_PASS=YOUR_NODEMAILER_PASSWORD
    NODEMAILER_EMAIL=YOUR_NODEMAILER_EMAIL

    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
    CLOUDINARY_APIKEY=CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
    ```

> **Note**: Always keep your API keys confidential. Do not expose them in the client-side code or public repositories.

5. **Run the server:**
  - For development:
    ```
    npm run start:dev
    ```
  - For production:
    ```
    npm start
    ```



## ‚≠êÔ∏è Future Development Plans

The application is set for some exciting updates. Here's what's planned for the future:

- **Introduction of Admin Role**: The backend and routing have been designed to easily add an admin role. This role will bring new levels of management and oversight to the app.

- **Two-Step Verification for Tutor Accounts**: There are plans to add a two-step verification process for tutors. This will help in ensuring that the content they publish is secure and trustworthy.

- **Expanded Dashboard Notifications**: The dashboard will be upgraded to show more notifications. Users will be informed about new posts, comments, messages from tutors, and other important updates.

- **User Engagement Enhancements**: The app will include new features to make it more interactive and engaging. This might include elements like badges for achievements or personalized learning paths.
